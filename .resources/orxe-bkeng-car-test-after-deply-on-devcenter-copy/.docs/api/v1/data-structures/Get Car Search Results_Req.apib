+ sessionId: `28000bd3-5659-41c0-ab11-e99751fb74c0` (string, required) - Unique session ID for the current session. You must obtain the sessionId for the current session from the Initiate Car Search API's response. The session ID is valid for 60 minutes from the time it is generated.
+ currency: `USD` (string, required) - 3-character ISO code that indicates the currency in which you want to retrieve monetary amounts.

If you want to configure multiple currencies, then please contact cxLoyalty Business Team. Consider a scenario where you set the currency field value to USD and the car vendor's currency is in AUD. The API calculates the AUD to USD amount equivalents and displays monetary amounts in USD.
