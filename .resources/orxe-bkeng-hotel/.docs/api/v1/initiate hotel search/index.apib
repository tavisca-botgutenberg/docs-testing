# Initiate Hotel Search [/hotel/v1.0/search/init]
This API initiates an <@ asynchronous_search @> for hotels, which is typically the first step in the shopping process. You can search for hotels either within a [given radius from a point of interest](#radial) or within a [given rectangular geo region](#rectangular). You can search for hotels that can accommodate up to 8 guests per room (occupancy). This limitation can vary per <@ supplier @>. 

You can also refine or customize your search by specifying <@ filters_body @>. For example, the `minHotelRating` and `maxHotelRating` filters allow the user to view only those hotels that are within the quality of service that they want.

## Initiate Search for Hotels within a Radius [POST]
A radial search allows you to easily find hotels that are located within a specified distance (radius) from a given point of interest (location). This location is also called as the reference point or the center.<br>
For example, with our API, you can easily search for all hotels that are located within a 5 km radius from the CDG (Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport) airport.
