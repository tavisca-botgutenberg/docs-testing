## paging (object)
+ pageNo: 1 (number, required) - Indicates the start page from where you want to retrieve the search results. The response returns the result set only from the `pageNo` that you specify while considering the number of search results per page based on the `/paging/pageSize` field.Consider a scenario where you set the `/paging/pageSize` field to `10`, which means that the response will return 10 search results per page. If you want the response to return the search results from the 21st search result (record) and skip (ignore) search results 1 to 20. In this scenario, you must set the `pageNo` field to `3`.<b>Default value:</b> `1`.
+ pageSize: 10 (number, required) - Indicates the number of search results/records that the response must return per page.For example, if you want the response to return `10` search results per page, set the `pageSize` field to `10`.<b>Default value and Maximum value:</b> `200`.
+ orderBy: `price asc` (string) - Indicates the sort criteria/order in which the response must return the search results.You can sort the search results by:<br>- `price asc` (Ascending order of total fare)<br>- `price desc` (Descending order of total fare)<b>Default value:</b> `price asc`.

## contentPrefs
+ contentPrefs (array[contentPrefsEnum], fixed-type) - Indicates the different types of car content that you want to retrieve. By default, the `contentPrefs` field is set to return all basic car content, which includes rental location information and vehicle content.Consider a scenario where you want to retrieve only the policies for the car. In this scenario, you must set the `contentPrefs` field to `Policies`. The `contentPrefs` field ensures that the API consumers can choose what content they want the API to return based on their use case without compromising on the response size or latency. The static content for a car can be a large volume of data. Retrieving all this information at once can cause high latencies in e-commerce applications and low bandwidth devices. As a result, OTAs need to ensure that they only retrieve content that they want to use or display on their application. The `contentPrefs` field takes care of this need. To make it even easier to retrieve car content, we have categorized information into predefined groups of information that have common properties or related data to get rid of the need to specify each field when retrieving the car content.The options include:<br>- `All` retrieves all the information about the rental location and vehicle available with the content provider.<br>- `Equipment` retrieves, in addition to the basic information, the information about the equipments available for the vehicle.<br>- `Policies` retrieves, in addition to the basic information, the information about the rental policies.
