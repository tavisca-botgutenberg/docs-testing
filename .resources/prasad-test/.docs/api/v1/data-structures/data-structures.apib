## currencyRQ
+ currency: `USD` - 3-character ISO code that indicates the currency in which you want to retrieve monetary amounts. The API calculates the amount equivalents and returns the amounts in the currency specified. For example, if the `currency` field value is set to `USD` the car fare, discount, taxes, and other monetary amounts are returned in their `USD` amount equivalents. We support all <a target="_blank" href="../reference-reads/#supported-currencies">ISO currencies</a>. If you want to configure multiple currencies, then please contact cxLoyalty Business Team.<br><br>Consider a scenario where you set the `currency` field value to `USD` and the car vendor's currency is in `AUD`. The API calculates the `AUD` to `USD` amount equivalents and displays monetary amounts in `USD`.<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> If you do not set a value for the `currency` field, the `currency` value will automatically be set based on the default account configuration.

The static content for a car can be a large volume of data. Retrieving all this information at once can cause high latencies in e-commerce applications and low bandwidth devices. As a result, OTAs need to ensure that they only retrieve content that they want to use or display on their application. The `contentPrefs` field takes care of this need. To make it even easier to retrieve car content, we have categorized information into predefined groups of information that have common properties or related data to get rid of the need to specify each field when retrieving the car content.<br><br>The options include:<br>- `All` retrieves all the information about the rental location and vehicle available with the content provider.<br>- `Equipment` retrieves, in addition to the basic information, the information about the equipments available for the vehicle.<br>- `Policies` retrieves, in addition to the basic information, the information about the rental policies.
